# 🎯 Improving Relevance in Your RAG System

## Current Setup Status ✅
- Relevance thresholds: 0.4 (search) / 0.3 (chat)
- Good document chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
- Conversation history support

## Quick Fixes You Can Try Right Now:

### 1. 🔧 Adjust Thresholds in `chat.py`
```python
# Line 156: For broader search (finds more results)
def search_documents(self, query, n_results=5, relevance_threshold=0.2):

# Line 271: For broader chat responses  
search_results = self.search_documents(query, n_results=5, relevance_threshold=0.1)
```

### 2. 📝 Better Question Patterns
**Technical Skills Queries:**
- "What programming languages does Igor know?"
- "What networking equipment has Igor worked with?"
- "List Igor's technical certifications and skills"
- "What specific Cisco technologies does Igor have experience with?"

**Follow-up Strategy:**
1. Start broad: "Tell me about Igor Matsenko"
2. Get specific: "What are his technical skills?"
3. Drill down: "What networking technologies does he specialize in?"

### 3. 🔍 Increase Search Results
```python
# Line 271: Get more potential matches
search_results = self.search_documents(query, n_results=10, relevance_threshold=0.3)
```

## Advanced Improvements:

### 4. 🧠 Multi-Query Search
Add this method to your RAGChatbot class:

```python
def enhanced_search(self, original_query):
    """Try multiple query variations for better recall"""
    query_variations = [
        original_query,
        f"skills {original_query}",
        f"experience {original_query}", 
        f"technologies {original_query}",
        f"technical {original_query}"
    ]
    
    all_results = []
    for query in query_variations:
        results = self.search_documents(query, n_results=3, relevance_threshold=0.2)
        if results:
            all_results.extend(results)
    
    # Remove duplicates and return top results
    unique_results = []
    seen_docs = set()
    for result in all_results:
        doc_text = result['document'][:100]  # First 100 chars as fingerprint
        if doc_text not in seen_docs:
            seen_docs.add(doc_text)
            unique_results.append(result)
    
    return unique_results[:5]  # Return top 5 unique results
```

### 5. 📊 Context-Aware Queries
```python
def build_contextual_query(self, user_query, chat_history):
    """Enhance query with chat context"""
    if len(chat_history) > 0:
        recent_context = " ".join([entry['user'] for entry in chat_history[-2:]])
        enhanced_query = f"{recent_context} {user_query}"
        return enhanced_query
    return user_query
```

### 6. 🏷️ Better Metadata Usage
When training documents, add more specific metadata:

```python
# In train_documents.py, enhance metadata
metadata = {
    'source': filename,
    'chunk_id': chunk_id,
    'content_type': 'resume',  # Add content classification
    'section': detect_section(chunk),  # Skills, Experience, etc.
    'char_count': len(chunk)
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes:

### Test Questions to Try:
1. "What technical skills does Igor have?"
2. "What networking equipment has Igor worked with?"
3. "List Igor's programming languages"
4. "What Cisco technologies does Igor know?"
5. "What cloud platforms has Igor used?"

### Monitor Results:
- Check relevance scores (should be >30% for good matches)
- Verify source attribution 
- Test follow-up questions in same conversation

## 🎚️ Threshold Recommendations:

| Use Case | Search Threshold | Chat Threshold | Results |
|----------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Precise** | 0.6 | 0.5 | Fewer, highly relevant |
| **Balanced** | 0.4 | 0.3 | Current setting |
| **Broad** | 0.2 | 0.1 | More results, some noise |
| **Maximum Recall** | 0.1 | 0.05 | Finds everything, lots of noise |

Start with **Broad** settings for skills queries, then adjust based on results!
