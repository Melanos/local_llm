# 🎉 Enhanced Document Image Extraction

## ✅ Successfully Implemented!

You now have **automatic image extraction** from documents! Here's what was added:

### 🆕 New Features:

1. **📷 Document Image Extractor (`extract_document_images.py`)**
   - Extracts images from DOCX, PDF, and PowerPoint files
   - Saves extracted images with descriptive names
   - Links images to their source documents

2. **🔧 Enhanced Document Trainer**
   - Optional auto-extraction during document training
   - Configure via `config.py` → `"auto_extract_images": true`

3. **📁 Organized Storage**
   - Extracted images go to: `data/images/extracted/`
   - Move relevant ones to: `data/images/` for training

### 🚀 How to Use:

#### Method 1: Manual Extraction
```bash
# Extract all embedded images from documents
python extract_document_images.py

# Review extracted images
# Move interesting ones to data/images/
# Train on them
python train_images.py
```

#### Method 2: Auto-Extraction (Recommended!)
```python
# In config.py, set:
"features": {
    "auto_extract_images": True
}

# Then train documents (images auto-extracted)
python train_documents.py
```

### 🎯 What Gets Extracted:

- **DOCX**: Images embedded in Word documents
- **PDF**: Images and diagrams from PDF pages  
- **PowerPoint**: Images from presentation slides

### 📋 File Naming Convention:
- `document_name_img1.png` (DOCX images)
- `document_name_p1_img1.png` (PDF page 1, image 1)
- `document_name_slide1_img1.png` (PowerPoint slide 1, image 1)

### 🔗 Benefits:

1. **Automatic Discovery**: No more manually extracting images
2. **Source Linking**: Images are linked to their source documents
3. **Smart Training**: Can train on both document text AND embedded images
4. **Complete Coverage**: Analyze documents holistically (text + visuals)

### 💡 Example Workflow:

1. Add a PowerPoint with diagrams to `data/documents/`
2. Run `python extract_document_images.py`
3. Review extracted diagrams in `data/images/extracted/`
4. Move relevant ones to `data/images/`
5. Train: `python train_images.py`
6. Ask: "What does the network diagram in my presentation show?"

This gives you **complete document understanding** - both textual content and visual elements! 🎊

### 🔧 Dependencies Added:
- `PyMuPDF` for PDF image extraction
- Enhanced existing DOCX and PowerPoint support

The system now provides **true multi-modal document processing**! 🚀
