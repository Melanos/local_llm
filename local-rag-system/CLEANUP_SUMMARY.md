## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the cleaned repository** to ensure functionality
2. **Update documentation** to reflect new structure  
3. **Consider the comprehensive model analysis** for production deployment
4. **Archive contains** test results and analysis data for reference

## 🔧 Recommended Configuration

Based on the comprehensive analysis:
- **Use CLIP ViT-B/32** as the primary embedding model
- **Remove Nomic Embed** from production (quality issues)
- **Keep Jina v4** for specialized high-dimension use cases
